# wordle
My original implementation of Wordle (by the New York Times).
The game selects a random 5-letter word from a word list (a subset of the list of valid guesses).
The player has 6 guesses to guess the word. Each guess entered must be in the list of valid guesses.
A letter in the correct position turns green.
A letter present in the word but in the wrong position turns yellow. 
Letters can be used more than once, and answers are never plurals.
